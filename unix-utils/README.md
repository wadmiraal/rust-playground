# Unix Utilities
**The gist:** clone simple, tried and true Unix commands.

_Inspired by [Projectbook](https://projectbook.code.brettchalupa.com/command-line-interfaces/unix-utilities.html)_

Target is to implement the following:

- [ ] `cat` — output the contents of a file, line by line, to stdout
- [ ] `ls` — list the files of the current or passed in directory
- [ ] `grep` — search through the contents of target files for a match
- [ ] `less` — read-only file viewer, particularly useful for longer files
- [ ] `sort` — order lines alphanumerically
- [ ] `tail` — print last n lines of a file, can follow output with -f, useful for logs
- [ ] `wc` — displays the number of lines, words, and bytes in a file
